>**Industrial Copper Modeling**

## Introduction:

The Industrial Copper Modeling project aims to forecast both the selling price and transaction outcome (won or lost) in the copper market using machine learning techniques. Through thorough data exploration, cleaning, and preprocessing, the project applies a range of regression and classification algorithms to build models capable of making precise predictions.

>## Dataset:

The dataset for this analysis captures key details of industrial copper transactions, including variables like selling price, quantities, and transaction outcomes (won or lost). It provides an in-depth overview of the copper market and the factors that affect transaction success.

[Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18eR6DBe5TMWU9FnIewaGtsepDbV4BOyr/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=104970222914596366601&rtpof=true&sd=true)

>## About the Data:

- id : Serves as a unique identifier for each transaction, essential for tracking.
  
- item_date: Reflects the transaction date, helping to monitor business activity over time.

- quantity tons: Shows the item quantity in tons, which is crucial for gauging production or sales volumes.

- customer: Refers to the customer involved, vital for tracking sales and maintaining relationships.

- country: Indicates the customer's country, useful for analyzing geographical sales trends and logistics.

- status: Represents the transaction’s current state, helping track its progress, such as "Draft" or "Won."

- item type: Classifies items for better inventory management.

- application: Describes the item’s use, valuable for targeting marketing and development efforts.

- thickness: Details item thickness, crucial for materials where size affects functionality.

- width: Provides the item’s width for understanding its size.

- material_ref: Tracks the material used, key for monitoring product composition.

- product_ref: Identifies specific products, facilitating easy cataloging.

- delivery date: Notes expected or actual delivery dates, helping manage logistics.

- selling_price: Represents the selling price, fundamental for revenue and profit analysis.

>## Regression model details:

The copper industry typically handles relatively straightforward data on sales and pricing. However, this data can be prone to issues like skewness and noise, which can reduce the reliability of manual predictions. Addressing these challenges manually is often time-intensive and may lead to suboptimal pricing decisions. Machine learning regression models can help overcome these issues by applying techniques like data normalization, outlier detection and correction, managing incorrectly formatted data, analyzing feature distributions, and using advanced models like decision trees for improved accuracy.

>## Classification model details:

The copper industry also encounters challenges in lead capture. A lead classification model helps assess and categorize leads based on their likelihood of conversion. The STATUS variable can be used for this, with WON representing a successful lead and LOST indicating a failed one. Data points with statuses other than WON or LOST can be excluded from the analysis for more accurate results.

>## Learn from the Project:

Exploring Skewness and Outliers: Assess the distribution of variables in the dataset to detect any skewness or outliers. This helps evaluate the quality of the data and identify potential issues that could impact model accuracy.

Data Transformation and Cleaning: Prepare the data for analysis by performing necessary transformations and cleaning tasks, such as addressing missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

Machine Learning Regression Models: Implement a range of regression algorithms to predict industrial copper's selling price. Compare models like linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting to determine which performs best.

Machine Learning Classification Models: Use different classification algorithms to predict the status of copper transactions (won or lost). Test methods like logistic regression, support vector machines, and random forests to classify outcomes.

Evaluation and Model Selection: Assess the performance of both regression and classification models using metrics like mean squared error (MSE), accuracy, precision, and recall. Choose the best models based on these evaluations.

>## Methodology:

### 1. Data Loading:
Import the industrial copper dataset using the pandas library. Conduct an initial exploration to understand its structure and content.

### 2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Address missing data, remove outliers as needed, and perform necessary transformations like encoding categorical features. This ensures the dataset is properly formatted for analysis.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Leverage pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to explore the dataset. Examine the distribution and relationships between variables by generating visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, and box plots to extract insights.

### 4. Machine Learning Regression:
Implement several regression algorithms to forecast the selling price of industrial copper. Split the dataset into training and testing subsets, train the models, and evaluate them using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE).

### 5. Machine Learning Classification:
Utilize various classification algorithms to predict the transaction status (won or lost). Divide the dataset into training and testing sets, train the models, and assess their performance using accuracy, precision, and recall.

### 6. Documentation:
Create detailed documentation outlining the analysis process, including data preprocessing, the machine learning models used, and their performance. Include visualizations and interpretations to clearly communicate the findings.

>## Conclusion:

The Industrial Copper Modeling project focuses on forecasting the selling price and transaction outcomes (status) in the copper market by leveraging machine learning methods.
